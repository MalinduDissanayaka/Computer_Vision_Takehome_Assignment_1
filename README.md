This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 1** of EC7212 – Computer Vision and Image Processing. The assignment covers various basic image processing techniques implemented in Python using OpenCV and Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📝 Tasks Covered

1. **Intensity Level Reduction**  
2. **Image Blurring with Average Filter (3x3, 10x10, 20x20)**  
3. **Image Rotation by 45° and 90°**  
4. **Block Averaging (3x3, 5x5, 7x7) for Spatial Resolution Reduction**

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

1. Make sure your input image is placed in the `images/` folder.
2. Open each `.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter.
3. Run all the cells to process and generate outputs.
4. Results will be saved automatically in the respective `outputs/` subfolder.

---

## 📸 Sample Results

Check the `outputs/` folder for:
- Reduced intensity images
- Blurred images
- Rotated images
- Block averaged images

---

## 📌 Notes

- All images are processed in **grayscale**.
- You can modify kernel sizes, angles, and intensity levels as needed.
- Make sure your image is named `input.jpg` or change the filename in the code.
